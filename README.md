# CS50x
This repository is related to the projects made during Harvad's CS50x course.
I'm using this repo to track my personal growth and share my experience.


## Week 0 -
**Scratch** - It is an excellent way to learn complex topics such as loops,condiitonals etc in an interactive way.
I built an interactive 2-D obstacle game. I was able to use conditionals, loops and collision detection effectively.



## Week 1 - C

### mario_less.c
- **What I learned**: Basics of C loops, handling user input, and nested for-loops.
- **Challenges**: Struggled with aligning the pyramid initially.
- **Reflection**: Took me 2 days, but it helped build my logic thinking.

### mario_more.c
- **What I learned**: Symmetry in output and formatting using nested loops.
- **Challenges**: Understanding how to manage space vs hash count on each line.
- **Reflection**: Took less than an hour after understanding the loop logic from the previous problem.

### cash.c
- **What I learned**: Greedy algorithm basics and floating-point handling.
- **Challenges**: Realized loops weren’t necessary for everything — overthought it initially.
- **Reflection**: Felt rewarding to implement logic in a simple way.
